  - Threebox new method `tb.setBuildingShadows(options)` that instantiates a new `BuildingShadows` class.
  - Threebox new method `tb.setSunlight (newDate = new Date(), coords)` that calculates real Sun light position at a given datetime and lnglat calling `tb.getSunPosition(date, lng, lat)`.
  - Added `this.lights` to enable access to lights configured for the scene through `defaultLights` or `realSunLight`. 
  - Light Helpers (if any) are now updated on `tb.update` calling `this.updateLightHelper()`, useful to see the sun direction on animations.

- [**#33**](https://github.com/jscastro76/threebox/issues/33) Refactored methods `òbj.add` and `obj.remove` to enable add an object to them (honestly this never worked as it was referring to root which is the function.)

- Threebox initialization params are now validated at the beginning. 
- [**#23**](https://github.com/jscastro76/threebox/issues/23) Updated sample [mercator.html](https://github.com/jscastro76/threebox/blob/master/examples/mercator.html) to test the changes in `obj.duplicate()` method comparing duplication with new instances creation.
- Preparation for including post-effects  

#### :beetle: Bug fixes
- [**#16**](https://github.com/jscastro76/threebox/issues/16) Bug in `obj.duplicate()` method. It was a *Three.js* bug [**19900**](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/19900) but it was resolved here through the addition of a copy constructor.
- [**#23**](https://github.com/jscastro76/threebox/issues/23) Bug in `obj.duplicate()` method. It's not cloning properly all the members of a Threebox Object3D such as `obj.animations`, `obj.boundingBox`, `obj.boundingBoxShadow`, `obj.anchor`, etc...

## 0.3.0

#### Enhancements

- Add an Object class: convenience methods to produce lines, spheres, tubes, and imported OBJ/MTL meshes, as well as a method to bring in THREE.Object3D's produced elsewhere with vanilla Three.js. Most of these are moveable, and have methods to move/rotate/rescale

- No need to call `tb.update()` after putting it in the custom layer's `render()` function.

#### Bug fixes

- Automatically adjust for viewport size (https://github.com/peterqliu/threebox/issues/43)

#### Deprecated (but still functional)
- `.setupDefaultLights()` has moved to an optional `defaultLights` parameter, in the third argument for Threebox().
- `tb.addAtCoordinate()` and `tb.moveToCoordinate()` have been deprecated. `tb.add(Object)` and `Object.setCoords()` replace them
